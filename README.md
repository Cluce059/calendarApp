# Work Day Scheduler 

## Purpose
An application to help the user visualize their daily tasks in relation to the current time of day.
The workday spans from 9am to 5pm, but can be refactored for any time span.
Time blocks in red represent the current time,
time blocks in green represent the day ahead. Past hours will not be colored in.
